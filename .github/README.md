# Biolink

<p>This is my temporary solution, while I work the kinks out of a fullstack implementation that others can use as well, for my need to have a "link in bio" page (aka a linktree alternative). </p>

## Problem to Solve

- Site for aggregating my links to various social media, vcs and chat platforms
  - work with text effects and other new design ideas I have been experimenting with in my efforts with awesomewm
